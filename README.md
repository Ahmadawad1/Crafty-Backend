# Crafty: Automate Craftsmen Booking & Online Payments
Crafty is a cloud-based innovation project still under development (.NET, Flutter, and Azure) and it's meant to be launched by mid 2025. 

This project aims to streamline home improvement by automating the process of finding and booking skilled craftsmen (carpenters, plumbers, electricians, etc.). You can:
- Search & Quote: Easily find craftsmen by specialty and receive instant quotes for your project.
- Secure Booking: Schedule appointments directly through the platform with your chosen craftsman.
- Seamless Payment: Pay securely online after service completion for peace of mind.

This project aims to simplify the home improvement experience by eliminating the need for phone calls, manual scheduling, and insecure payments.
